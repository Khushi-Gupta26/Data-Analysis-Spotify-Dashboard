# Spotify-Top-50-World-Data-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation Using Ms Excel,Power BI)

I developed a Comprehensive Project in Power BI with the help of MS Excel, creating  multiple dashboards to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

## 📌Project Objective/ Business Requirement

Spotify stakeholders (music analysts, playlist managers, and marketing teams) need a consolidated dashboard to monitor song and artist performance across different dimensions.
This project transforms raw Spotify Top 50 chart data into an interactive business intelligence dashboard. The solution was built with a focus on actionable insights, following a clear data pipeline:

•	Tech Stack: The analysis and data transformation were performed using Excel with visualizations and the final interactive dashboard built in Power BI. Data is modeled for clarity and easy analysis.

•	Analytical Process:
	Data Acquisition & Cleaning: The raw dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and new metrics (like average popularity per artist) were calculated.

## 📌About Dashboard:

i.	KPI & Feature Engineering: Core KPIs (Total Songs, Distinct Artists, Average Popularity) were defined and computed. Data was structured to support drill-down analyses by artist, song, and time.
ii.	Dashboard Development: Four interconnected dashboard pages were created in Tableau to directly address each business requirement:

-	Index Page: It is the main /Cover page of the Project.
-	Overview Page: Provides executive-level KPI monitoring and high-level trends.
-	Artist Page: Enables deep-dive analysis into artist performance and consistency.
-	Songs Page: Allows for granular tracking of individual song performance over time.

1.	Overview Page
o	Track KPIs like Total Songs, Distinct Artists, Average Popularity, Avg Duration.
o	Compare Explicit vs Non-Explicit Songs and see their share.
o	Analyze Songs by Album Type (single, album, compilation).
o	View Distinct Songs and Average Popularity by Year.
o	Trend analysis of Average Popularity & Distinct Songs by Month.
o	Highlight Top Songs & Top Artists by Popularity.

2.	Artist Page
o	Show Top Artists by Popularity.
o	Compare Tracks per Album and Songs by Artist.
o	Provide drill-down to artist-level data (songs, release date, average popularity, average position, duration).
o	Support identifying artists with consistent hits and #1 positions.

3.	Songs Page
o	Rank Top Songs by Popularity.
o	Show Tracks per Song (Album/Single distribution).
o	Compare Songs by Song Count.
o	Provide detailed table with song name, release date, distinct artists, avg popularity, position, duration per year.

## 📌 Conclusion:

Currently, Spotify’s raw “Top 50” dataset is limited to lists and rankings, making it difficult for stakeholders to see patterns and take insights quickly.

From the screens, the key problems solved are:

•	No clear KPI monitoring → Dashboard provides quick summary of total songs, artists, popularity, duration, etc.

•	Lack of explicit vs non-explicit analysis → Users can compare how explicit songs perform vs non-explicit.

•	Difficulty in tracking song/album distribution → Visuals show breakdown by album type and release year.

•	Trend visibility missing → Popularity and distinct songs trends are shown over time (monthly & yearly).

•	Artist vs Song level insights not connected → Drill-down pages for Artists and Songs connect overview insights to detailed records.

•	Decision-making gaps → Marketing and curation teams can now identify which artists/songs to promote, trends to follow, and which content resonates with audiences.
